### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.

+ _main.Rmd_ is the final report, and contains the ATE estimate and runtime results from all six approaches on both datasets. Note that both the low-dimensional and high-dimensional datasets must be in the _data_ folder for the notebook to run.

+ _ADS Project 4 Presentation.pptx_ contains the final presentation given in class.

+ _main\_scratch.Rmd_ contains the results for the from-scratch full matching algorithm on both datasets. The algorithm itself is in the lib folder named _propensity\_fullmatching.R_.
